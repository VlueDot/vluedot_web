            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>This privacy policy describes how VCore and Veep, as part of the Vluedot ecosystem, manage, protect, and
                respect personal data and information generated by their users. Our commitment is to ensure the
                confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data, in strict compliance with international
                regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR - EU), the California Consumer Privacy
                Act (CCPA - USA), and the Personal Data Protection Law (Law No. 29733 - Peru).</p>

            <h3>1. Privacy and Design Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Privacy is integrated into the platform's design ("privacy by design").</li>
                <li>Information is processed with advanced security technologies that enable encrypted operations without
                    exposing
                    the content.</li>
                <li>The use of personally identifiable data is avoided, using internal identifiers that are not traceable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Information Security</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All data is protected using robust and configurable encryption systems, with the possibility to increase
                    its complexity based on the sensitivity level or operational risk.</li>
                <li>Only the user or the issuing organization has full control over access to the data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Data Retention and Control</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>By default, user information and conversations are kept for a maximum period of 6 hours.</li>
                <li>Users can modify this setting, request immediate deletion or anonymization of their data.</li>
                <li>Automatic history cleaning mechanisms are applied to prevent unnecessary data accumulation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Use of Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Data is not used to train third-party artificial intelligence models or for commercialization purposes.</li>
                <li>The platform may suggest options based on usage patterns and user preferences, without third parties
                    directly
                    accessing this information.</li>
                <li>Companies integrating services through VCore cannot view or exploit users' personal data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Transparency and Compliance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Users have access to reports, activity logs, and audit mechanisms regarding the use of their data.</li>
                <li>Key GDPR principles are followed: purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation,
                    integrity,
                    confidentiality, and proactive accountability.</li>
                <li>VCore offers tools that facilitate compliance with the right to be forgotten, data portability, and the
                    withdrawal of consent.</li>
            </ul>
